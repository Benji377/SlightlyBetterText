# TODO

## Background Task
> High priority

Make the app launch in the background and be always ready to input text.
Further, add the shortcut mechanism to open/close the editor

## Settings
> Medium-low priority

Add a settings JSON or something to be able to set some stuff like different keybindings and where
the text editor saves files

## CLI support
> Medium priority

Add CLI support, meaning you can actually open and close the UI from the CLI and pass arguments to it.
I don't think I will actually create a CLI editor.

## Editor modifications
> Medium-high

Make it so that the editor opens without creating an underlying file.
Ask for a file name when saving and be able to create one or not.
Auto-generate file names based on date and time.

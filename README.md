# SBT - SlightlyBetterText
> Work in Progress!

A very simple text editor written in Rust. Its focused on simplicity and performance.

## Usage
Hide/Unhide this app using the magic shortcut. Once you do, you can simply start typing and the texteditor will capture it right away.
in _hide_ mode, it does not even pop-up, only you know its tracking your text (kind of like a Keylogger). In _normal_ mode it pops-up and you can use it as a simple notepad.

Magic shortcut: CTRL+ALT+SPACE

## Settings

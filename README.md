# SBT - SlightlyBetterText
> Work in Progress!

A very simple text editor written in Rust. Its focused on simplicity and performance.

## Usage
It simply starts in the background at startup and waits for you to start typing the magic shortcut. Once you do, you can simply start typing and the texteditor will capture it right away.
in _hide_ mode, it does not even pop-up, only you know its tracking your text (kind of like a Keylogger). In _normal_ mode it pops-up and you can use it as a simple notepad.

## Settings
Settings and customizations coming soon!

## Plugins
